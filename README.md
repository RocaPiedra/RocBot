Personal project where I build and program an onmidirectional AMR!

## Motors

### Basic Info
I'm using a set of 4 DC motors with encoder, you can find the parameters if the motors in the MotorParameters.xml file.

Currently I'm trying to do precise speed control using an arduino uno.

At Jan 21st a low pass filter added to the speed control (both in RPM calculation and PWR output calculation) has improved the signal as seen in the no_filtering vs filtered graphs. The response is slightly slow, it still needs improving.

### PID Calibration
Jan 22nd: Kp = 0.8, Kd = 0.1, Ki = 1.0
Response is slow and barely keeps up with fast paced changes in target RPM. Signal has little jitter, for now good enough. The signal does not seem to have offset error at all and can converge to the target RPM. Increasing proportional value for a faster response should help if I manage to balance it with the derivative term.

## IMU
Currently I have a GY-BNO080 9 DOF IMU that I bought for 15â‚¬, my objective is to read data through the arduino board using i2c. I've never used this protocol before but it seems quite useful for a 2-pin protocol.

The IMU datasheet says it runs at 3.3 V so I've connected to the 3.3 V output of the arduino. SCL goes to A4 for the clock signal and SDA goes to A5 for data signal. Through i2c scanning I found the IMU's address to be 0x4B - 75

Had to change the microcontroller in order to take advantage of Adafruts great library, currently using to interface with the IMU an Arduino Mega2560 Pro Mini (than can actually fit the size of the library). 

For Mega SCL is in D20 and SDA is in D21.
